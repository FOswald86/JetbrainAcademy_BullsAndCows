# JetbrainAcademy_BullsAndCows  
  
In this project you can learn how to use integer arithmetic, generate random numbers, store data in data structures, and handle errors.  
  
If a symbol in the given answer matches a symbol and its position in the code, it's called a "bull." If a given symbol appears in the code but its position doesn't match, then it's called a "cow". If all the symbols are bulls, the secret code has been guessed and the game ends.
